# mpu9250-library

A Dependency Injection based SPI Driver library for the MPU9250 9-DOF IMU from InvenSense.  
This is a work in progress, see Status for more information.

## Usage
Check out [mpu9250.h](lib/include/mpu9250.h) for the C language interface, or [mpu9250.hpp](lib/include/mpu9250.hpp) for the C++ language interface.  
A C++ adaptor is provided in [mpu9250_if.hpp](lib/include/mpu9250_if.hpp) to adapt between c++ driver objects and the underlying c implementation.  

For C use you will need to implement an SPI driver function with the prototype `int8_t spi_transfer(void* context, uint8_t len, uint8_t *data_out, uint8_t* data_in);`.  

For C++ use you can use the above function, or create an object extending `MPU9250::SpiDriverInterface` that implements the method `int spi_transfer(uint8_t len, uint8_t *data_out, uint8_t* data_in)`.  

Both of the above functions should return >= 0 for success, < 0 for failure. For an example (using [USB-Thing](https://github.com/ryankurte/usb-thing) check out the [util](/util/source/main.cpp).
